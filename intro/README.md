# Overview

Code from OSTEP chapter [Introduction](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/intro.pdf).

To compile, just type:
```
prompt> make
```

See the highly primitive `Makefile` for details.

Then, run them! Examples:

```
prompt> ./cpu A
```

```
prompt> ./mem 1
```

```
prompt> ./threads 10000
```

```
prompt> ./io
```
